# build-mcp-server

A portable Agent Skill for designing, building, auditing, and migrating Model
Context Protocol servers. The skill guides agents through use-case discovery,
deployment-model selection, tool/resource/prompt design, auth choices,
scaffolding, testing, and deployment.

The current guidance targets the released MCP `2026-07-28` stateless protocol
and keeps compatibility with the initialization-based 2025 era explicit. Its
default TypeScript scaffold uses the official v2 split packages, and its
migration playbook covers modern-only and dual-era upgrades.

This repo contains one skill: `build-mcp-server`.
